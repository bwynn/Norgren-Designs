      "heading" : "Our Design Philosophy â€“ An Uncommon Perspective.",
      "content" : "Engineering is often perceived as a dry, technical, numbers game, transforming ideas into products through mathematical tools and methods. Norgren Designs understands that 3D modeling, FEA, and other technical engineering practices are tools that can easily be wasted without a solid foundation on which to apply them. We value the highly creative stage in the design process that is often overlooked and undervalued. We excel at this creative stage by leveraging experience and intuition to quickly arrive at an optimal starting point. Any design can be optimized in a technical sense, but not every optimized design is an optimal solution. We focus on the creative stage up front to set your project up for success later."
