Norgren-Designs
===============

A 3 page portfolio site, built mobile-first. I have been working on this project off and on with my friend Erik after work when our schedules give us free time to meet up. 

I wanted to build this site as basic as possible, while leaving room for scalability for when Erik wants new content added. The mobile first design means that I built the site from the viewport size of an iPhone in portrait mode, at 320px. As the design changes and the layout scales up, the layout expands and adapts to the new viewport window. My objective for this project is to build the whole responsive site using 2 additional media queries: a medium viewport for phablets and tablets, and a large viewport for desktops up to 1400px.
